                <p class="grid5-grid4-grid3">There are some applications which integrate machine, software, and special information to impart reasoning and advising. They provide explanation and advice to the users.
                    Doctors use clinical expert system to diagnose the patient.
                    Police use computer software that can recognize the face of criminal with the stored portrait made by forensic artist.</p>
